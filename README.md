# Chevy Bolt EV Internals

This is a small collection of things i've discovered about the Chevy Bolt EV.

We haven't seen any OTA radio updates to the head unit, beatings will continue until
morale improves.

## OnStar

OnStar is a built-in 4G LTE-based data service which also lets you make phone calls to talk to OnStar representitives.

### OnStar Service Plans

Every Bolt EV comes with at least 5 years free of "EV Mobile Command". This lets you control the car, and see battery state of charge through the built-in 4G LTE modem.

### OnStar Instability

OnStar in 2017-2019 Bolt EV's has a habbit of going into periods of failing to serve requests for diagnostic information.

The end result is the battery SoC stops refreshing in the myChevrolet application, and API calls (for example via [onstar2mqtt](https://github.com/michaelwoods/onstar2mqtt) stop functioning until the vehicle is physically powered on again.

**Observations:**

* Unlocking and relocking the doors via remote - get_diagnostic request still failing
* Physically opening and closing doors - get_diagnostic request still failing
* Issuing vehicle commands through API (lock, unlock) - Functional, but get_diagnostic request still failing afterwards
* Plugging vehicle into a Level 2 charger - get_diagnostic request still failing
* Getting into vehicle, powering car on - get_diagnostic requests working again

After extensive trial-and-error, there doesn't seem to be a fixed set of conditions leading to this event. There also is no fix beyond physically powering the vehicle on via the start button.

### Disabling OnStar

OnStar can be disabled by powering the vehicle off (important per the repair manual, it has a battery) and pulling the OnStar fuse from the fuse panel under the drivers steering wheel.
Once disabled, [a blank filler plate](https://thingiverse.com/thing:5199130) can be 3d printed to replace the physical OnStar buttons.

Overall, the vehicle works as expected with the OnStar module disabled except for one problem. The in-vehicle microphone for bluetooth telephone calls will no longer function.
The microphone runs through the OnStar unit which seemingly amplifies or re-encodes the audio signal for the radio.

It might be possible to "bridge" the microphone directly to the radio unit via the following pins of OnStar X2 connector:

* 9 B24 Cellular Phone Microphone +
* 10 B24 Cellular Phone Microphone ground

* 6 Radio / Navigation Microphone +
* 12 Radio / Navigation Microphone -
* 5 Radio / Navigation Microphone ground

Connecting 9/10 to 6/12 might provide a functional in-vehicle bluetooth audio experience. Untested.

### Physical Access to OnStar module

The OnStar module (K73 Telematics Communication Interface Control) is physically located directly behind the central infotainment screen.
Access is not easy as you will need to remove the dash trim (containing the AC vents), then unscrew and remove the infotainment screen assembly.

## Hidden functions

* Radio Reboot
  * Press and hold HOME + Fast Forward to reboot the infotainment.
  * This is a hardware feature and will solve any of the common radio "lockups"
* Service Mode
  * The shop manual documents a "Service Mode" for troubleshooting.
  * With the vehicle off, this is activated by holding the power button
    for 5 seconds with your foot *not* on any pedals.
  * The car will enter a "not ready" state, but systems will be online.
  * Press the power button again to exit.
* Debug Menu
  * On 2017-2021 model units, there exists a hidden debug menu that is
    locked with a passcode. You can access this menu by tapping the empty
    area in the apps screen under Gallery 12 times. The code that will unlock
    all (known) menus is '1029475638185'. Upon hitting OK, there won't be any
    immediate indication that anything has changed. Go to the settings menu and
    scroll all the way down. There will be three new menus with debugging functions.
  * '20150105' and '20150106' are codes that also work but will give you less menus.
  * Most of these functions either don't do anything or crash the radio.
  * These menus will disappear once the radio is rebooted
  * It is unknown if anything here could result in hacking into the radio's software.
    I believe this is uncharted territory though, something could exist!
  * These codes were found in LG's Open Source Software.

## Battery Recall

As of late 2020, NHTSA and GM began noticing an increasing trend of battery fires
unrelated to damage, accident, or abuse. Fires were seen in vehicles charging quietly
in owners garages overnight, or had finished charging recently. The issue begins with
smoke exiting the highest point in the battery pack (the service disconnect under the
rear seat). The entire car is eventually engulfed in flames damaging the surrounding
structure and vehicles.

A "final" software fix was released in April / May for impacted Bolt EV vehicles. (NHTSA 20V701)

After the final software fix, additional vehicles suffered the same fault prompting
another recall. (NHTSA 21V56)

On August 20th, 2021, the overall cause of fires reported by GM are two manufacturing
defects within the LG produced LiPo cells:

* A torn anode tab
* A folded separator

The combonation of these two defects is speculated to create an internal short within
the battery during normal cycling (expansion, contraction, etc) between the anode
and cathode resulting in a fire developing. Given the close proximity of cells, the fire
rapidly consumes the entire pack.

## Radio

![Bolt EV Radio Control Unit](images/radio.jpg)

* Radio Receiver S-band HD
  * GM Part Name: "Radio Control Unit"
  * Model Years
    * 2020 - 42728517 aka 42724911 / 42743929
    * 2019 - 42680220 aka 42676913 / 42746460
    * 2018 - 42670713 aka 42525185 / 42621253 / 42649077
    * 2017 - 42671556 aka 42571029 / 42583079
  * Made by LG Innotek for GM
  * Model LC10S , LC10-S , LC10SB , LC10-SB
  * FCC "Silver box radio" https://fccid.io/BEJLC10SB
  * Supports Bluetooth, 2.4Ghz WIFI and 5 Ghz Wifi.
  * Wireless Android auto requires 5 Ghz wifi, so the head unit can "technically" be upgraded to it in the future.
  * Seems to be QNX based
  * Firmware updates are signed and look like the following:
    * indication.16008211.0 -- Checksum?
    * update/42490971.bin -- Unknown
    * update/42615022_CPU.bin -- Unknown.. Likely encrypted QNX IFS filesystem
    * update/42615022.mnf -- Unknown.. Likely some manifest of what's in update package
    * update/42615022_OP.bin -- Unknown.. Likely more encrypted QNX updates
    * update/42615022.smd -- PEM Encryption keys, public. Checksums, sha256WithRSAEncryption
  * QNX IFS filesystems can be extracted, but since these are encrypted, the encryption would need to be broken first.
    * Private keys must exist on the head unit, and need extracted
    * Tools like https://github.com/askac/dumpifs exist
* Chevy Bolt EV OEM Radio Navigation 10" screen
  * GM Part Name: "GPS Navigation System"
  * Model Years
    * 2020 - 42620584
    * 2019 - 42662676
    * 2017,2018 - 42556932
  * Seemingly just a "Serial LVDS" touch screen and display?
* FM antenna is integrated into the rear window, with a connection via a three-pin female connector (only one pin is used) running to the FM amplifier near the middle of the top of the hatch just above the glass (visible once the plastic inner shroud is removed).  Technicians replacing the rear glass may forget to make the antenna connection, resulting in very poor FM reception.

### Upgradability

> Purely theoretical. Using the wrong parts may cause damage!

* Since the 2017 + 2018 model years used the same display, the radio receiver should be electrically "swappable" between them.
  * Obviously the ECU might have something to say about a non-matching radio control unit.
* 2019, 2020 both have a differing part number for the display.
  * It could be minor mechanical differences however?
* The Bolt EV service manual is the same? per GM for 2017-2019 so the pinouts may be identical?

### Radio Firmware Updates

![GM Communication](images/gm_communication.webp)

* Radio performs a DNS lookup of vtmpub.oboservices.mobi
  * CNAME *USED* to be vtm-oboservices.nam1.lbx.gm.com (66.235.235.112, "Quality Technology Services")
  * CNAME *NOW* rcms-na-oboservices.nam1.lbx.gm.com (198.208.178.32, GM Subnet)
* TLS ECDSA certificate required.  No matching ciphers for RSA certificates.
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (secp256r1) - A
  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (secp256r1) - C
* Vehicle checks the remote server aginst a trusted pool of GM CA's
  * tlsv1 alert unknown ca:SSL alert number 48) while SSL handshaking
* Radio requests information from server (likely VIN tied)
* TLS guards from seeing any information about this request :-(

### Man in the middle

![GM Communication](images/mitm.webp)

* Radio does not seem susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. TLS certificates are fully
  validated on the radio, and the request fails.

## Chevy Calibrations (aka, firmware updates)

Chevy releases new calibrations (software patches) for their cars, classically these have been to adjust things like engine timing. However, in an EV these updates adjust things like DCFC charging curves.
**20-NA-053** is a service bulletin for all 2017-2019 Chevy Bolt's released by GM to improve DCFC in cold weather.

To get this update, you have to head to the dealership, ask your service technician *NICELY* and trust that they'll actually apply it.
...or, you can apply it (and any future updates) yourself.

> I'm pretty sure GM offers acdelcotds.com to the public because of right-to-repair laws. They're just betting you don't know how to use it. Now you do!

### Terms

* SAE-J2534 - All new vehicles need to support these standards to reprogram systems which can include emmissions control changes
* Tech2 - An older diagnostic system for GM vehicles. You don't need to mess with this
* GDS2 - GM's current diagnostic system, which supports firmware updates via SAE-J2534
